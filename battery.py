"""Q-C001 consciousness indicator battery — scoring, aggregation, calibration.

DESIGN NOTE — why this is not a checklist
------------------------------------------
The obvious implementation scores each indicator and counts the satisfied ones.
That is wrong, and wrong in a way that inflates results, so this module refuses
to do it.

Butlin et al. (2023, Table 1) do not claim "N of 14 satisfied => consciousness".
They claim that *some subsets are jointly sufficient*, and each indicator is
necessary *according to at least one theory*. That gives three distinct problems
a count cannot handle:

1. **Intra-theory correlation.** RPT-1 and RPT-2 come from one theory about one
   mechanism. Counting them twice is double-counting evidence.
2. **Inter-theory non-independence.** The theories are not independent
   hypotheses either. A system that satisfies GWT-2 (bottleneck + selective
   attention) typically gets GWT-3 (broadcast) nearly free.
3. **Necessity vs sufficiency asymmetry.** Failing one indicator of a theory
   that treats it as necessary is far more informative than satisfying the other
   thirteen.

So the aggregation here runs in two stages:

    stage 1: collapse indicators WITHIN a theory to one theory-level verdict
             (a theory's bundle is what it cares about, not its parts)
    stage 2: combine theory-level verdicts with a noisy-AND over theories

and the final number is a credence, not a verdict. The battery returns bounds and
decompositions, never a boolean.

Also implemented here, because a battery nobody has calibrated is not a
measurement instrument: `calibrate_known_answers`, which runs the scoring
function against reference systems whose consciousness status is not in dispute.
If the battery cannot separate a human from a lookup table, its output on
frontier models is uninterpretable and the gate fails closed.

Evidence states (RESEARCH_RULES.md §8) are carried through, not silently
promoted. A verdict computed from UNTESTED evidence is returned as UNTESTED.

    2. **Multiplicative penalty for confirmed-absent necessary indicators

       theory is not enough if several indicators that theories jointly call
       necessary are affirmatively confirmed absent at controlled evidence or
       better. Each such absence multiplies the credence down.

    `lower` applies the penalty only for conjunctive theories. `upper` also

    jointly sufficient. The gap between them is the price of the unresolved
    question of whether agency and embodiment are required, reported rather than
    collapsed.
